    <h3>About:</h3>
    
    <p>My name is <b>Daniel Shiang</b> and I am a born and bred San Diegan. My whole life, I've been surrounded by breathtaking natural wonders, 
        which influenced me to study marine biology at UC San Diego during my undergraduate days. However it was the sense of duty that
        ultimately led me into my lab manager position at the Moore's Cancer Center at UC San Diego. Now, as an M.S. Software Development 
        student at Boston University Metropolitan College, I ultimately aspire to become a developer for academic institutions and 
        laboratories.

        <br/>
        <br/>  
        Outside of work and all productivity related matters, I am an avid explorer and nature enthusiast. I've been to over 20 countries,
        countless national/state/county parks, and am the point of contact for non-San Diegans for weekend San Diego itineraries. I also
        spend quite a bit of time in our sister city, Tijuana, and try to show the world that our neighbor to the South is more than 
        what the mainstream media portrays it as. I ultimately aspire to travel to all seven continents and climb Kiliminjaro in the next
        decade.
